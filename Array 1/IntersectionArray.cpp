  Time and Space Complexity

  ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
Let:

n = arr1.size()

m = arr2.size()

Then:

Outer loop runs n times

Inner loop runs up to m times for each element of arr1

Time Complexity = O(n * m)
‚ùó Worst case: every element of arr1 needs to be compared with all elements of arr2.


üß† Space Complexity:
We're using only:

An output result vector (to store common elements)

No extra data structures like hash sets, maps, etc.

Space Complexity = O(min(n, m))

Because in the worst case, all elements of the smaller array could be common.

   üìà Time and Space Complexity Analysis

     1. Time Complexity:
Code Breakdown:
Outer Loop (while i < arr1.size() && j < arr2.size()): This loop runs as long as both pointers (i for arr1 and j for arr2) haven't reached the end of their respective arrays.

Pointer Increment: Each pointer (i and j) is incremented at most n or m times where n is the size of arr1 and m is the size of arr2.

Worst-Case Scenario:
In the worst case, both pointers will traverse through all elements of their respective arrays.

Thus, the total number of iterations is bounded by O(n + m).

Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(n + m) (when all elements match quickly)

Worst Case: O(n + m) (when no or few elements match)

2. Space Complexity:
Space Used:
We only store the common elements in the result vector.

The result vector can hold a maximum of min(n, m) elements, where n is the size of arr1 and m is the size of arr2 (in the worst case, all elements might match).

Space Complexity:
Space Complexity = O(min(n, m))
(because the result array stores at most min(n, m) elements)
